# Course Info

EECS151 Tapeout is a Decal (student-run course) giving a hands-on, end-to-end experience in SoC design and implementation culminating in a [tapeout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out).

Students with a background in the fundamentals of digital design and VLSI CAD tools (EECS151 + ASIC lab) will learn how to use the [Chisel](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) hardware description language and [Chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard) (an agile hardware design framework) to integrate their EECS151 ASIC core or a custom IP block of their own design into a full-scale System-on-Chip (SoC). While covering the basics of agile SoC design concepts and methodology, the course is primarily a hands-on experience. One (or more, depending on student interest) class SoCs are planned to be taped out in the open-source Skywater 130nm process at the end of the semester. **Extra chip area is available for motivated students with unique, large-scale projects.**

The course aims to give all students hands-on experience in every step of the SoC design process from system-level design (interfaces, modular decoupling), to toplevel integration and physical design with commercial CAD tools though Berkeley’s [Hammer](https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer) tool. Students will participate in a class project consisting of one or more physically realized and fabricated SoCs in the [open-source](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/) Skywater 130nm process node. Student contributions to the designs may range from a chipyard-integrated version of their EECS 151 ASIC core to custom accelerators or off-chip peripheral interfaces. It is emphasized that while multiple students may collaborate on a single SoC (or even within a module), every student will receive hands-on experience with the full tapeout process, from system architecture to GDSII signoff.

This course spans 13 weeks. Class meets for two hours once a week. Each class will generally consist of a short mini lecture, overview of project status, and check-ins with each team on milestones and obstacles. Students are expected to spend a bit more time each week outside of class time working on their project. **The ultimate goal of this course is to tapeout on the Cadence SkyWater 130nm shuttle.**
<!--**The semester may culminate in chip tapeout through ' [chipIgnite](https://efabless.com/chipignite), student presentations, and a class poster.**-->


### Enrolling in EECS151T

Enrollement has ended for Spring 2026. Email us for more information!

<!--Fill out [THIS](http://berkie.ee/bhjq05) form to join! Our DeCal listing from Spring '25 is [https://decal.studentorg.berkeley.edu/courses/7769](https://decal.studentorg.berkeley.edu/courses/7769). More information about enrollment will be sent to those who fill out the enrollment form.-->


### Prerequisites

This course is designed for students who have completed EECS 151 LA ASIC and/or EE 194/290C (the traditional 'Tapeout' and 'Bringup' courses). Students who instead completed EECS 151 LB FPGA are welcome but may have a higher learning curve due to less prior experience with ASIC CAD flows. Students who have not completed EECS 151 or Tapeout/Bringup are recommended to take this Decal after having completed the course. Those unsure are welcome to email us. We are extremely welcoming to self-motivated students of various backgrounds but do wish to emphasize that background knowledge will be helpful, especially as this is an early iteration of the course.

### Grading

We will keep track of grade-related things mostly in Gradescope. Other course content will be found here on the [website](https://151tapeout.berkie.ee/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/ucb-eecs151tapeout). When in doubt, ask on the Discord: [berkie.ee/151t-discord](https://berkie.ee/151t-discord)

### Office Hours

We may have work and "office hours" sessions. You can also organize your own work sessions. We will use this calendar to track them.
