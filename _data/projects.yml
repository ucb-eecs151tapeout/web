# To add an assignment to the website:
# 1. Upload any necessary files (e.g. starter code) to the assets folder.
# 2. Put the assignment spec in /labs or /projects or /homeworks (if not already there).
# 3. In this file, add a "link" attribute to display a link to the spec.
#    You can use "hide_links: true" to not render the link.

# Each element in the array corresponds to one box on the website.
# This includes boxes that are blank or don't have an assignment.

# The website automatically numbers each element in the array.
# To skip numbering (e.g. for a blank box), add "nonumber: True" as an attribute.

# The fields available in each array element that you can use:
# - title:      The main text displayed in the box.
#               If blank, uses auto-numbering and displays "Project 1", "Project 2", etc.
#               If not blank, overrides auto-numbering and displays your title. This means
#               your title must do the numbering yourself (e.g. "Project 1A: Deques").
# - link:       Link that the title goes to when clicked.
#               Can be blank if you don't want the title to link to anything.
#               If this is an external link to a different website, it should start with http://
#               or https://. For example, "https://example.com" is good, "example.com" is bad.
#               If this is an internal link to another page on this website, you should write a
#               relative filepath starting at the root of this repo, e.g. "/assets/images/logo.png".
# - hide_links: Whether to render links in the box.
#               If true, the title and part links are NOT rendered.
#               If false (or not listed), all non-empty links for the title and parts are rendered.
#               Your title links to your link iff hide_links is false/unlisted AND "link" is not blank.
#               The parts link to your links iff hide_links is false/unlisted AND the "link"s are not blank.
#               Note that if your "extra" has a link, it's rendered whether this is true or false.
# - due:        If not blank, shows this date on the grid (regardless of release status).
# - parts:      An array of names/links to parts. These appear below the main title/link,
#               with parts separated by slashes.
#               See the "link" section above for how to render external/internal links.
# - extra:      Write any arbitrary markdown in here if you want to add to the box.
#               **Warning**: You should only use this sparingly for one-off links, e.g. an extra
#               PDF that only appears in one cell. **Do not** use this for recurring links like
#               adding "Slides" to every assignment - that should go in "parts" instead.
#               "parts" has built-in aria-label tags to help distinguish recurring links like
#               "Slides" in every cell, but "extra" does not have these tags, so each "extra"
#               that you add should be distinct from all the others.
# - rowspan:    How many rows this assignment should take up on the syllabus grid.
# - classes:    You can add an array of classes here to change the color of the box or otherwise
#               format the box. Common colors like "schedule-purple" or "schedule-green"
#               are built-in for you, and you can add your own in _sass/custom/custom.scss if you want.
# - nonumber:   If true, displays the title and nothing else.
#               Also ensures the auto-numbering will not increment from this box.

# Example usage of all of the above:
#
# - title: "Project 1: Deques"
#   link: "/proj1/"
#   hide_links: false
#   due: "09/06"
#   parts:
#     - name: "Part A"
#       link: "/proj1/part-a"
#     - name: "Part B"
#       link: "/proj1/part-b"
#   extra: "[Special PDF](https://www.google.com)"
#   rowspan: 3
#   classes:
#     - schedule-purple

# projects:
#   - nonumber: true
#   - title: "Get to know your potential collaborators!"
#     # link: "/proj1/deliverables"
#     # due: "2025/01/29"
#     # # "parts" can also be used for other recurring text in the boxes, like slides.
#     # parts:
#     #   - name: "Slides"
#     #     link: "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RM9EOWqfaNzy9FP-Ud22fS3xz7xIQDFBXQe0jrEN5rQ"

#   - title: "Make sure you have access to your (functional) EECS151 CPU - if yours has issues, make some friends!"

#     # # "extra" should be for one-off links. For recurring links, use "parts" instead.
